### Topics (to explore engineering concepts):
* style
* data structures & algorithms
* design and implementation
* **inteface**: interfaces between users, programs, and parts of programs are fundamental. Much of the success of software is detemined by how well interfaces are designed and implemented.
  - abstraction
  - information hiding
  - resource management
  - error handling
* debugging
* testing
* performance
* portability
* notation

### main idea: good software based on
* simplicity: short and manageable
* clarity: easy to understand
* generality: fit in wide situations

### Why I care
to be more proficient, effective, and productive as a software engineer

## Style
