## Computer Architecture and Engineering

### tips of cs152
* The course is organized into five modules, each module with a problem set and a lab.
* Labs will provide hands-on experience with the iteraction of software and hardware, for a variety of machine design.
* Make extensive use of designs written in the Chisel hardware description language.
* Each lab includes a directed component to guide students in learning certain concetps.
* Each lab includes an open-ended assignment to allow students to show their creativity.
* The diliverable for each lab is a lab report.
* Problem sets are for you to practice your understanding of the course material.
* Problem sets also provide essential background material for the midterms.
* Solutions to the problem sets are provided.
* Exams including 2 midterms and the final exam, covering material learned in readings, labs, and problem sets.
* Textbook: Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, 6th
* Grading: problem sets (15%), labs (25%), exams (60%, 15 + 15 + 30)
* Using automatic code generators such as OpenAI Codex, Github Copilot, or chatGPT is not allowed.
